# Mailman Setup 

## Web server setup

The default web server is **_apache2_**, alternatively nginx is ok. 

In this tutorial I will configure a virtual host with the hostname **_lists.example.com_** where I will install Mailman. **_lists.example.com_** is also the right part of the mailing list email addresses that will be configured in Mailman, i.e., mails to a mailing list will have to be sent to the address **_\<listname\>@lists.example.com_**.
